                    <p>Taking in consideration the different lifestyles of people today, there are various ways for you to help become part of the movement, which include:</p>
                    <bold><h3> Volunteering</h3></bold>
                    <p>
 Whether you would like to know more about the issue, practice your articulation skills, or get to know the kids, there is something for everyone! </p>
 <bold><p>Mentorship Program </p></bold>
 <p>Each hospitalized youth will be paired up with a volunteer at the four main locations we work at based on interest, language, and other factors. The volunteer is responsible for visiting the youth three to seven times a month, where the volunteers will give the opportunitiy for the youth to pursue thier passion with another like-minded person. For the volunteers, this is an amazing opportunity to learn more about life inside the hospital walls and to connect with these youth.</p>
 <Bold><p>Long-Distance Video Program </p></Bold>
 <p>Is there something you are passionate about? Soccer,magic tricks, music? If so, you can:
a) Create a small tutorial for the hospitalized youthto see. Ideas include how to make beats with your
body (if you're passionate about music), or how to do cool kicking tricks with the soccer ball. Just
remember who the videos are for (hospitalized youth, some who are physically unable to do more
complicated, skilled actions). But most of all, have fun with the video. It could be anywhere from 1 to
3 minutes long. And don't worry about the language, we'll put Thai subtitles in so that the hospitalized youth will be able to understand. 
b) Skype the kids. While filming and editing a video is a great way to immortalize a tutorial and make it accessible to the kids even after the class is done,Skype is a more interactive platform to engage with
the kids.  Even if you want to make a video showing your city,these youth have never been outside Thailand, so even that would make an incredible contribution for them. 
 
If you're interested in volunteering, you can either apply through our partner NGO Abroad 
here or directly to us through our application form. We welcome both people currently living in Thailand and those living abroad! 
Stay tuned in our page at Idealist.org . We may have paid internships open, where you will be able to have the opportuntity of being a part of the management team, strategic development, and finances of the organization as well as getting to interact and be a mentor if you so wish!
